      "prompt": "What is Composite Pattern?",
      "answer": "The composite pattern describes a group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to \"compose\" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly."
